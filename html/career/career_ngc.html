<p>After graduating from Cal Poly Pomona, I joined the <a href="http://www.northropgrumman.com/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC)</a> at the site in <b>Azusa, California</b> as an <b>Electronics Engineer.</b><br><br>
I started my career on the <b>Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS)</b> program where I tested flight hardware, conducted Test Readiness Reviews, redlined schematics for flight CCA to mitigate parts obsolescence and single point failures, and drafted cable interconnect drawings.<br><br>
While still on the SBIRS program, I transitioned to the <b>Special Test Equipment</b> group to expand my knowledge base. There I the designed test cables and created interconnection drawings for payload test sets. I also helped with engineering checkout and hardware integration.<br><br>
One day there was a call for volunteers to help the <b>Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV)</b> program. I volunteered to go to <b>Salt Lake City, Utah</b> for a few months. There I was part of the design of their replacement test sets. I also helped with troubleshooting and engineering checkout.<br><br>
When I returned to Azusa, I joined the <b>DSP On-Orbit Support and Sustainment Contract (DOSSC)</b> program as a Data Analyst where I did log file extractions, analyzed data, authored reports, and wrote various Unix/Linux scripts.<br><br>
There was another call for volunteers to travel and resolve critical engineering issues on the <b>Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)</b> weather satellite program. I volunteered to travel to <b>Hauppauge, New York</b> for a month. Although I had a limited RF background, I quickly picked up and performed testing on Radio Frequency (RF) flight modules.<br><br>
When I came back, I continued on with flight instrument testing, designed cables, and did the preliminary flight design for an in-rush current limiter. I also coordinated activities as the liaison between Production Control, Supply Chain Management, Subcontracts, Manufacturing, Mission Assurance and Team Leads for multiple Integrated Product Teams (IPTs).<br><br>
After a successful delivery of the JPSS1 instrument, I decided I wanted to step outside of the space hardware world. Thus I recently I transferred to Northrop Grumman’s site in <b>Baltimore, Maryland</b>. I am excited to for the opportunity to be part of the <b>Test Design Engineering</b> department where I will be working with test equipment for radar systems.</p><br><br>
