-don't focus tooo much on your website as it won't naturally get as much attention as youtube or linkedin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxD-boFg2GY


-keep website as personal and not professional. don't advertise it to recruiters except when asked about my skills.

-since i will not use this for a pro site, make minimal fixes to the message and the mobile effects, do seo, then move on to other projects. can update later when i get bored.
-maybe write less content in my bio, etc. or leave it as is. good enough. move on.

#future ideas and improvements
-----------------------

#website update/redesign ideas
-maybe make a simple professional site one day with a pic of me being confident
see video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DNv3PEuPO8

-maybe aim to make it more professional, else just let friends look at it. people are too judgmental.

-note: can move the "x" close button on some of the slide in pages, etc. and make it a little lower since phones have a menu bar at the top. (maybe). but every phone is different.
-you may want to change the delay time of text fading in for mobile sites. maybe,

-----------------------
#old notes and references (just for archive)
-----------------------
				
code a bootstrap personal page
	use videos as needed
	upgrade it later. good enough for now

	
	get content (pics) for careers, education, passions, and quote sections
	style the backgrounds next
	
	
maybe add the song body and soul to play when you reached the contact and credits section of the webpage
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko2c5yJp8G8



use gradient generator for div color styling
http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/
or sections can use a nice background image like this
http://www.hannahsilverton.com/ see let's talk




maybe redo contact form to use icons like this guy
	also check out his resume page as well
http://www.albinotonnina.com/

	
fade in pic on scroll
example, see portfolio section: http://www.hannahsilverton.com/


list skills: hardware, software, design, testing and troubleshooting, analysis, technical writing, communication, leadership


change accent colors
	grab color from blue tie and use it
for hero pic, use high key blue casual
	maybe hero pic is blue glasses and shirt and black and white pic
for about me use form blue tie low key

	
		
		
	
    
    
		

for the passions background video make one like this
